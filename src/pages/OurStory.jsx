          <h2>From Adversity to Legacy: The De Globe Cafe Story</h2>
          <p>
            In 2019, De Globe Cafe opened its doors in the heart of Hazratganj, Lucknow, replacing a Mughal-theme restaurant with a fresh, global-inspired caf√© experience. The response was heartwarming‚Äîguests loved our warm ambiance, handcrafted beverages, and thoughtfully curated menu. The future looked bright.<br/><br/>
            But then, the Covid-19 pandemic changed everything. India went into lockdown. Streets were empty, businesses shut down overnight, and uncertainty loomed. Many cafes and restaurants were forced to close permanently, but we made a decision‚Äîwe would not let our team struggle.<br/><br/>

But then, the Covid-19 pandemic changed everything. India went into lockdown. Streets were empty, businesses shut down overnight, and uncertainty loomed. Many cafes and restaurants were forced to close permanently, but we made a decision‚Äîwe would not let our team struggle.<br/><br/>

With no revenue coming in, we still ensured timely rent payments and full salaries for our staff, because they were our family. It was tough. It was uncertain. But we believed in our people and our passion. When the world reopened, our community stood by us. Slowly, but steadily, we rebuilt what we had started.<br/><br/>

Today, De Globe Cafe is not just a caf√©‚Äîit‚Äôs a story of resilience, hope, and passion. Our coffee and tea are now among the most loved in Hazratganj, a testament to the journey we undertook. Every sip you take here is brewed with the struggles, dreams, and unwavering spirit that kept us going.

Welcome to De Globe Cafe‚Äîa place where every cup tells a story.
